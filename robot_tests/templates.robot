Goal: Initialize new standard robot.
  Step        build/rcc robot init -i --controller citests -t standard -d tmp/standardi -f
  Use STDERR
  Must Have   OK.

Goal: Standard robot has correct hash.
  Step        build/rcc holotree hash --silent --controller citests tmp/standardi/conda.yaml
  Must Have   1cdd0b852854fe5b

Goal: Running standard robot is succesful.
  Step        build/rcc task run --space templates --controller citests --robot tmp/standardi/robot.yaml
  Use STDERR
  Must Have   From rcc point of view, actual main robot run was SUCCESS.
  Must Have   OK.

Goal: Initialize new python robot.

  Use STDERR
  Must Have   From rcc point of view, actual main robot run was SUCCESS.
  Must Have   OK.

Goal: Correct holotree spaces were created.
  Step        build/rcc holotree list
  Use STDERR
  Must Have   rcc.citests
  Must Have   templates
  Wont Have   rcc.user

Goal: Can get plan for used environment.
