### What to consider when upgrading from series 10 to series 11 of rcc?

Major version break between rcc 10 and 11 was about removing the old base/live
way of managing environments (`rcc environment ...` commands). That had some
visible changes in rcc commands used. Here is a summary of those changes.

- Compared to base/live based management of environments, holotree needs
  a different mindset to work with. With the new holotree, users decide which
  processes share the same working space and which receive their own space.
  So, high level management of logical spaces has shifted from rcc to user
  (or tools), where in base/live users did not have the option to do so.
  Low level management is still rcc responsibility and based on "conda.yaml"
  content.
- All `rcc environment` commands were removed or renamed, since this was
  an old way of doing things.
- Old `rcc env hash` was renamed to `rcc holotree hash` and changed to show
  holotree blueprint hash.
- Old `rcc env plan` was renamed to `rcc holotree plan` and changed to show
  plan from given holotree space.
- Old `rcc env cleanup` was renamed to `rcc configuration cleanup`  and
  changed to work in a way that only holotree things are valid from now on.
  This means that if you are using `rcc conf cleanup`, check help for changed
  flags also.
- In general, the old `--stage` flag is gone, since it was base/live specific.
- Holotree related commands, including various run commands, now have default
  values for the `--space` flag. So if no `--space` flag is given, that
  defaults to `user` value, and the same space will be updated based
  on requested environment specification.
- Output of some commands have changed, for example there are now more
  "Progress" steps in rcc output.

## v11.1.5 (date: 24.9.2021)

- bugfix: performance profiling revealed bottleneck in windows, where calling
  stat is expensive, so here is try to limit using it uneccessarily

## v11.1.4 (date: 23.9.2021)

- bugfix: adding concurrencty to catalog check
- performance profiling revealed bottleneck, where ensuring directory exist
  was called too often, so now base directories are ensured only once per
  rcc invocation
- adding more structure to timeline printout by indentation of blocks

## v11.1.3 (date: 21.9.2021)

- bugfix: changing performance thru auto-scaling workers based on number
  of CPUs (minus one, but at least 4 workers)

  so that is why version series goes up to v8
