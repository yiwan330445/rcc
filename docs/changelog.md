# rcc change log

## v8.0.4 (date: 8.1.2021)

- now requires micromamba 0.7.7 at least, with version check added
- micromamba now brings --repodata-ttl, which rcc currently sets for 7 days
- and touching conda caches is gone because of repodata ttl
- can now also cleanup micromamba binary and with --all
- environment validation checks simplified (no more separate space check)

## v8.0.3 (date: 7.1.2021)

- adding path validation warnings, since they became problem (with pip) now
  that we moved to use micromamba instead of miniconda
- also validation pattern update, with added "~" and "-" as valid characters
- validation is now done on toplevel, so all commands could generate
  those warnings (but currently they don't break anything yet)

## v8.0.2 (date: 5.1.2021)

- fixing failed robot tests for progress indicators (just tests)

## v8.0.1 (date: 5.1.2021)

- added separate pip install phase progress step (just visualization)
- now `rcc env cleanup` has option to remove miniconda3 installation

## v8.0.0 (date: 5.1.2021)

- BREAKING CHANGES
- removed miniconda3 download and installing
- removed all conda commands (check, download, and install)
- environment variables `CONDA_EXE` and `CONDA_PYTHON_EXE` are not available
  anymore (since we don't have conda installation anymore)
- adding micromamba download, installation, and usage functionality
- dropping 32-bit support from windows and linux, this is breaking change,
  so that is why version series goes up to v8
